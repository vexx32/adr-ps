# 0002. Implement as Powershell

Date: 2018-08-09

## Status

Accepted

## Context

ADRS need to be created on a wide variety of platforms. For Windows developers and architects, Powershell comes out-of-the-box without pre-requisite installations.

## Decision

The tool was written and build as Powershell Module for better CLI support. A pure PS1 approach was considered but users would have to send prameters affront and requires more complex code.

## Consequences

As Powershell is a scripting language, the implementation is very transparent.
